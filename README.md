# Pair-Exercise-for-Intern

For this exercise, you will pair with a technical writer to edit the comments in the Java file that produce the documentation for the Anypoint Connector for WebSockets. 

This is not a test, and you are welcome to ask questions as you go along. Thinking aloud is encouraged. This is meant to be a fun exercise that simulates the real collaboration that takes place in the working environment.

Have fun!

1. Create your own branch. 
2. Edit the file using the tool of your preference. 
3. Commit your changes. 
4. Create a pull request.
